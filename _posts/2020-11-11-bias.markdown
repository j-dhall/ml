My research on bias.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

```C++
#include "markdown-parser.hpp"

int main(int argc, const char* argv[])
{
	// Main interface
	Markdown::Parser parser;

	// Flexible key-value configuration
	parser.configure("markdown-style", "solarized-dark");

	// Quick and easy snippet-conversion, returns HTML as std::string
	// <p><em>hello</em></p>
	auto snippet = parser.snippet("*hello*");

	// 65 possible styles (using highlight.js)
	parser.configure("code-style", "monokai");

	// Full file rendering
	parser.render_file("input.md", "output.html");
}
```
